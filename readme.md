# Proof of Concept: Logitech G PRO X Superlight 2 - Enhanced Polling Rate

This project aimed to provide users with the ability to increase the polling rate of the Logitech G PRO X Superlight 2 gaming mouse to 4000 Hz without relying on Logitech G HUB software.

However, with Logitech's introduction of polling rate adjustment functionality in [Onboard Memory Manager](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059641133-Onboard-Memory-Manager) software version 2.1.7479, this project became redundant. Users can now effortlessly adjust the polling rate of their Logitech G PRO X Superlight 2 mouse through official software, eliminating the need for third-party modifications.
